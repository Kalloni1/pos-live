**P.O.S.** (Probability of Satisfaction) introduces a new way to interpret product performance using real, verified purchase behavior â€” not just reviews.

ðŸ“Š It blends:
- Verified **sales**
- Verified **returns**
- Verified **reviews**
- Silent, satisfied buyers (those who don't return or review)

The result: a transparent, behavior-based 5-star score to help shoppers and sellers better understand true product satisfaction.

- âœ… Includes silent verified buyers â€” the ones who never return the product
- âœ… Ignores unverified reviews and review manipulation
- âœ… Helps new products with few reviews shine if buyers are satisfied
- âœ… Easy to integrate with Amazon, Home Depot, or your own store
